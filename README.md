## Welcome to Damanpreet's wesbite


* In my freetime, I love to read about new technologies in the industry
* One of my new interests is Machine learning, this is fairly new to me and I have always wanted to learn more about machine learning
* Another interest I have is learning about management techniques and new ways of managing a team, as this is what I want to do in the future.
## Technical Background
	I have held various positions in the IT field. My first job was a desktop support student technician at Grand Valley where I worked on setting up instructor stations, re-imaging computers, and setting up printers. I then got my first internship at Meijer as a software developer. 
	In this internship I developed a web application in C# about retrieving all on-prem applications. My second internship was with Stellantis. In this internship I did some linux administration and product evaluation of a new software that was going to be later implemented onto linux computers.

# Term Project

For this term project we will be creating a website. This website will be a employment management system that will help local small businesses in the Grand Rapids region to find employees. The point of this website is to match employees and employers together based on needs and qualifications. Employers can search for jobs and see the various opportunities for jobs available in GR. This will also help employees who are seeking to find work for a small business and match them. The goal of this website is to bring down the unemployment rate in Grand Rapids.
